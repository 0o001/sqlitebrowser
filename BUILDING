BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

SQLite Database Browser requires Trolltech's Qt, version 4.6. 
For more information on QT please consult
http://www.qtsoftware.com. The GPL version of Qt is available in almost 
all Linux distributions as a default package.

The only requirements for building this code are the presence of Qt and sqlite3.
Qt can be included as a static or shared library, depending on the current Qt
configuration on the building machine.

Provided you have Qt installed and configured, simply run

qmake

followed by

make

in the main directory. This will generate the sqlitebrowser (or
sqlitebrowser.exe, or sqlitebrowser.app) application in the src subdirectory.

The same process works for building the code
in any platform supported by Qt (including other Unix systems with
X11.) 

Please check the LICENSING.txt file for additional information.
